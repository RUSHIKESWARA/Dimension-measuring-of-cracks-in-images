# Dimension-measuring-of-cracks-in-images

This project focuses on using YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection and segmentation to identify and measure cracks in images. The system performs crack detection and segmentation, allowing accurate measurement of crack width and area. By utilizing YOLOâ€™s fast and efficient object detection capabilities, this project automates the analysis of structural cracks from images, providing vital information for maintenance and structural health monitoring.
